/*
Problem Statement :
You are given a N*N maze with a rat placed at maze[0][0]. Find whether any path exist that rat can follow 
to reach its destination i.e. maze[N-1][N-1]. Rat can move in any direction (left, right, up and down).
Value of every cell in the maze can either be 0 or 1. Cells with value 0 are blocked means rat canÂ­not 
enter into those cells and those with value 1 are open.
